# Boats Server

Part of a project by Tra Bouscaren and Grayson Earle.

Facilitates communication to and from individual boats. The server runs on Node.js and uses OSC to communicate with individual boats. Each boat has a Raspberry Pi and an Arduino attached. The Pi uses the Arduino as a means of controlling the motors. Eventually the server will also pipe video and other content to and from the boats.
